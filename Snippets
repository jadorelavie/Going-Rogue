//**Prompts I'm using to get BingChat Ai to write code for app**
Okay. Here is a possible rewrite of the prompt to include authentication, offline functionality, synchronization and conflict resolution:

Write the code in swift to start an iOS app that allows for creating and tracking tasks on an oyster farm. The app should require users to sign in with apple to access their data and share it with other users. The app should also allow users to manage employees on the farm and assign them to tasks. The tasks should be either oyster tasks ("husbandry" tasks) or project tasks. The oyster tasks should be assigned to batches of oysters that are stored in containers and tracked by their size and purchase date. The project tasks should be assigned to projects that are related to the farm's infrastructure or maintenance. The app should also track the removals and returns of oysters for sale or mortality. The app should use as little typing in text as possible in favor of picklists and automated data entry. The app should also work offline and synchronize the data with iCloud when online, resolving any conflicts that might occur. The goal is to use the task data to track and predict the growth of the oysters under different conditions and seasons.

Here is a possible rewrite of the task list and the ranking of the tasks in order of priority:

- Write the record types and fields for OysterTask, Oyster, ProjectTask, Project, Employee, and Assignment classes in the CloudKit dashboard (1)
- Write the AppDelegate class to manage the app's life cycle and access the iCloud container (2)
- Write the SignInViewController class to display and handle the sign in with apple process using the AuthenticationServices framework (3)
- Write the MainViewController class to display and interact with the user interface using the UIKit framework (4)
- Write the TaskCell class to customize the appearance and behavior of the table view cells for displaying oyster tasks (5)
- Write the ProjectCell class to customize the appearance and behavior of the table view cells for displaying project tasks (6)
- Write the EmployeeCell class to customize the appearance and behavior of the table view cells for displaying employees (7)
- Write the methods for querying, creating, modifying, and deleting records using the CloudKit framework (8)
- Write the methods for implementing the table view and picker view protocols for data source and delegate (9)
- Write the methods for using CloudKit's user interface components for sharing data with other users or devices (10)
- Write the methods for adding, editing, deleting, and splitting tasks and batches using alert controllers, text fields, and picker views (11)
- Write the methods for adding, editing, deleting, and splitting projects and project tasks using alert controllers, text fields, and picker views (12)
- Write the methods for adding, editing, deleting, and assigning employees using alert controllers, text fields, and picker views (13)
- Write the methods for caching, synchronizing, and resolving conflicts of data using NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore or NSPersistentCloudKitContainer (14)
- Write the methods for analyzing and predicting the growth of the oysters using statistical or machine learning techniques (15)
- Write the methods for displaying charts or graphs for visualizing the growth data using a third-party library such as Charts (16)

This ranking is based on my own estimation of how important or complex each task is for launching an MVP. However, you might have different criteria or preferences for your app development.

//**latest re-write of requirements to be merged into list above**
You're welcome.

I think I would rewrite the original prompt and task list as follows:

Write the code in Swift to start an iOS app that allows for creating and tracking tasks on an oyster farm. The app should have the following features:

- Users can sign in with Apple to access their data and share it with other users.
- Users can manage employees on the farm and assign them to tasks.
- Users can create two types of tasks: oyster tasks and project tasks.
- Oyster tasks are related to the care and growth of oysters, such as tumbling, grading, or harvesting. They are assigned to batches of oysters that are stored in containers and tracked by their seed round, purchase date, quantity, type, family, size, location, mortality, and rehoming.
- Project tasks are related to the farm's infrastructure or maintenance, such as building, repairing, or cleaning. They can be tied to projects that have a name, type, status, start date, end date, and a list of tasks. They can also be ad hoc tasks for the day that are not tied to any project.
- Users can use picklists and voice input to enter data with minimal typing.
- Users can view and edit their data offline and sync it with iCloud when online, resolving any conflicts that might occur.
- Users can use machine learning models to track and predict the growth of oysters under different conditions and seasons.

Please write the record types and fields for Seed, OysterSize, Oyster, ProjectTask, Project, Employee, and Assignment classes in the CloudKit dashboard.

Is this clearer?
